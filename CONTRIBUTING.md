# Preamble
You think about contributing something? We are happy to hear that and try to make this as efficient and hassle free as we possibly can.

# How to contribute?
1. Let's talk about it. Preferrably in the form of a github issue.
2. Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA_individual.md) and send it via e-mail to one of the maintainers of the project (we store CLAs separately for GDPR reasons). There is a separate form for those, [contributing as a corporate entity](CLA_corporate.md) and not as an individual.
3. Fork this repository.
4. Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository and make sure that sonar is happy with it (i.e. the quality gate holds).
5. Submit a pull request - we will get back to you shortly.
